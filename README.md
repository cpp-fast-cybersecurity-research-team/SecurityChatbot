# FAST_AI
This Project focuses on creating a chatbot, specialized in various cybersecurity topics. The chatbot is interactible through a web interface made using React.js and incorporates Flask to handle backend requests. Using Langchain, we are able to access GPTs functionality to make text-baseed requests. Additionally, we use vector databases to query information to specalize the chatbot with the resources we collected and stored.
