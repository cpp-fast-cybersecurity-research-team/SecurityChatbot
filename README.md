# Security Chatbot

This Project focuses on creating a chatbot specialized in answering various cybersecurity topics. The chatbot is interactible through a web interface made using React.js and incorporates Flask to handle backend requests. Using Langchain, we are able to access GPT related functionalities to make text-based requests as well as using Agents to interact with outside tools. Additionally, we use vector databases to query information related to a user's question which allows our chatbot to be knowledgeable with the resources we collected and stored.
